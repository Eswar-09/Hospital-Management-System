# OOPs Project

This repository contains the source code for an Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs) project. The project is designed to demonstrate various concepts of OOPs using C++.

## Project Description

The project is developed in C++ and focuses on implementing OOPs principles such as classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation. It simulates a hospital management system, where you can perform various operations related to hospitals, doctors, patients, and medical records.

## Features

- Hospital management: Add, search, and display hospital details including name, ID, location, contact information, bed capacity, rating, and year of establishment.
- Doctor management: Add, search, and display doctor details including name, specialization, gender, and degree.
- Patient management: Add, search, and display patient details including name, gender, and medical history.
- Disease management: Add, search, and display disease details including name and associated medicines.
- Medicine management: Add, search, and display medicine details including name.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/Eswar-09/Hospital-Management-System.git` 
2. Compile the source code: `g++ source.cpp -o Hospital-Management-System`
3. Run the executable: `./Hospital-Management-System`

## Dependencies

The project does not have any external dependencies and is developed using only the standard C++ library.
